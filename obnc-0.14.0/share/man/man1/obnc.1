.SH NAME
obnc \- build an executable for an Oberon module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B obnc
[\fB\-o\fR
.IR OUTFILE ]
[\fB\-v\fR | \fB\-V\fR] [\fB\-x\fR]

.B obnc
(\fB\-h\fR | \fB\-v\fR)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B obnc
builds an executable file for an Oberon module. Before the module is compiled, object files for imported modules are recursively created or updated as needed. Oberon modules are first compiled to C with
.BR obnc-compile .
Each C file is then compiled to object code with an external C compiler. Finally, the object files are linked into an executable program. Oberon source filenames are expected to end with
.IR .obn ,
.IR .Mod
or
.IR .mod .
All output files except the final executable are stored in the subdirectory
.IR .obnc .
.P
If for any module M there exists a file named
.I M.c
in the same directory as the Oberon source file then
.I M.c
will be used as the input to the C compiler instead of the generated file
.IR .obnc/M.c .
This provides a mechanism to implement a module in C.
.P
For any module M, environment variables for the C compiler specific to M and environment variables for the linker can be defined in a file named
.IR M.env ,
located in the same directory as the Oberon source file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h
Display help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR OUTFILE
Use pathname OUTFILE for the generated executable file.
.TP
.BR \-v
Without argument, display version and exit. Otherwise, output progress of compiled modules.
.TP
.BR \-V
Output progress of compiled modules with compiler and linker subcommands.
.TP
.BR \-x
Make cross compilation possible by compiling and linking modules from C source (if available) in a single command.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP CC
Specifies the C compiler to use (default is cc).
.IP CFLAGS
Options for the C compiler. The following constants can be customized with the flag -D name=value and are intended to be used with the cross compilation option -x:
.RS
.IP OBNC_CONFIG_USE_LONG_INT
Value 0 or 1 controls the use of `long' C type specifier for INTEGER and SET
.IP OBNC_CONFIG_USE_LONG_REAL
Value 0 or 1 controls the use of `long' C type specifier for REAL
.IP OBNC_CONFIG_TARGET_EMB
Value 1 builds an executable for a freestanding execution environment (embedded platform). With this option the C main function takes no parameters. The garbage collector is disabled and any call to NEW is invalidated. The executable is not linked with the math library libm.
.RE
.IP LDFLAGS
Additional options for the linker.
.IP LDLIBS
Additional libraries to link with.
.IP OBNC_IMPORT_PATH
See
.BR obnc-path (1)
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Getting Started
In Oberon, the program to print "hello, world" is
.P
.RS
MODULE hello;
.P
.RS
IMPORT Out;
.P
.RE
BEGIN
.RS
Out.String("hello, world");
.br
Out.Ln
.RE
END hello.
.RE
.P
Save the above module in a file named
.IR hello.obn
and compile it with the command
.P
.RS
obnc hello.obn
.RE
.P
This will create an executable file named
.IR hello .
When you run
.IR hello
with the command
.P
.RS
\[char46]/hello
.RE
.P
it should print
.P
.RS
hello, world
.RE
.SS Interfacing to C
To implement a module M in C:
.IP 1. 3
Create a file named
.I M.obn
with the the exported declarations
.IP 2. 3
Create a file named
.I MTest.obn
which imports M (and preferably write unit tests for M)
.IP 3. 3
Build MTest with the command
.P
.RS
obnc MTest.obn
.RE
.P
.IP 4. 3
Copy the generated file
.IR .obnc/M.c
to the current directory. In
.IR M.c ,
delete the generator comment on the first line and change the path in the include directive from
.IR M.h
to
.IR .obnc/M.h .
.IP 5. 3
Implement
.IR M.c .
.P
Note: The initialization function M_Init is called each time a client module imports M. Its statements should therefore be guarded with an initialization flag to make sure they are executed only once.
