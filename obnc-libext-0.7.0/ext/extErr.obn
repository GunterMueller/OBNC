MODULE extErr;
(**Output to the standard error stream*)

(*implemented in C*)

	PROCEDURE Char*(ch: CHAR);
(**writes the character ch to the end of the error stream*)
	END Char;


	PROCEDURE String*(s: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(**writes the null-terminated character sequence s to the end of the error stream (without 0X).*)
	END String;


	PROCEDURE Int*(i, n: INTEGER);
(**writes the integer i to the end of the error stream. If the textual representation of i requires m characters, i is right adjusted in a field of Max(n, m) characters padded with blanks at the left end. A plus sign is not written.*)
	END Int;


	PROCEDURE Hex*(i: INTEGER);
(**writes the integer i to the end of the error stream as a zero-padded unsigned hexadecimal number with a leading space.*)
	END Hex;


	PROCEDURE Real*(x: REAL; n: INTEGER);
(**writes the real number x to the end of the error stream using an exponential form. If the textual representation of x requires m characters (including a two-digit signed exponent), x is right adjusted in a field of Max(n, m) characters padded with blanks at the left end. A plus sign of the mantissa is not written.*)
	END Real;


	PROCEDURE Ln*;
(**writes an end-of-line symbol to the end of the error stream*)
