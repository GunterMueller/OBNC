INTRODUCTION

OBNC is a compiler for Niklaus Wirth's programming language Oberon. It translates Oberon modules into C code. The build command (obnc) invokes both the Oberon compiler (obnc-compile) and the host C compiler and sorts out all dependencies.

OBNC follows POSIX standard. This implies that it should compile and run on a POSIX compatible operating system.


INSTALLATION

1. Make sure you have Boehm-Demers-Weiser's garbage collector GC installed on your system. To use the basic library modules Input and XYplane you also need SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). On a Debian system you install these dependencies with the command

	apt install libgc-dev libsdl1.2-dev
	
2. Compile OBNC with the command
	
	./build
	
3. Optionally, run unit tests with the command

	./test

4. Install OBNC with the command

	./install

The default destination is /usr/local. If you want to use a different location, run `./install PATH'. To undo the installation, run `./install u' or `./install u PATH'.
