		X, Y: INTEGER; (*X = 0 and Y = 0. Included for compatibility with The Oakwood Guidlines.*)

	PROCEDURE Open;
(*initializes the drawing plane*)

(*erases all pixels in the drawing plane*)

	PROCEDURE Dot(x, y, mode: INTEGER);
(*Dot(x, y, m) draws or erases the pixel at the coordinates (x, y) relative to the lower left corner of the plane. If m = draw the pixel is drawn, if m = erase the pixel is erased.*)

	PROCEDURE Key(): CHAR;
(*reads the keyboard. If a key was pressed prior to invocation, its character value is returned, otherwise the result is 0X.*)
