.SH DESCRIPTION
.B obnc-path
prints the directory path for an Oberon module. For a module M, the printed path is the first directory found which contains either
.IR M.obn ,
.IR .obnc/M.sym
or
.IR M.sym .
.P
First the current directory is searched. Then paths in OBNC_IMPORT_PATH are searched. Finally the default library directory in the OBNC installation path is searched. 
.P
For each path P, modules are searched both in P and in first-level subdirectories of P. Subdirectories represent individual libraries and are expected to be in lowercase. For the modules in a subdirectory L, only modules prefixed with L followed by an uppercase letter are searched. The other modules in L are considered local to the library.
