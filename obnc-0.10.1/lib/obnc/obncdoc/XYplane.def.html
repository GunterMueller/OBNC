DEFINITION <em>XYplane</em>;
<span class='comment'>(*Basic facilities for graphics programming

Implements the basic library module from "The Oakwood Guidelines for Oberon-2 Compiler Developers". 

The drawing plane is repainted when Key is invoked. A minimal event loop is

	REPEAT UpdateDrawingPlane UNTIL XYplane.Key() = "q"
	
Fullscreen mode is toggled with Ctrl-f. It can also be exited with Esc.
